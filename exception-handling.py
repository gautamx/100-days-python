# without exception handling, exceptions would disrupt the normal operation of a program.

# When exceptions occur, the Python interpreter stops the current process 
# and passes it to the calling process until it is handled. If not handled, the program will crash.

# tryâ€¦.. except blocks are used in python to handle errors and exceptions. 
# The code in try block runs when there is no error. 
# If the try block catches the error, then the except block is executed.
